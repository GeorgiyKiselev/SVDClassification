# SVDClassification
Classification of Handwritten digits using SVD Methods. No machine learning frameworks were used for this classification, as it is meant to be an exercise of simple classification techniques - specifically linear algebra methods. 

This includes a paper explaining the process and analysis of result when compared to a naive distance based method.

The code is provided for reproducibility.
